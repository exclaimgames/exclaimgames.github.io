## FAQ

### How 'finished' will the games I get be?

They'll be fully functioning games with a few elements still in draft. So while the artwork, packaging and instructions may be a little raw, the way you play will be close to completion. That's not to say they won't evolve later on - your views on our prototypes will influence what happens to them next.

### How much feedback will you need on a prototype?

We'll send you a simple form to complete that should take no more that 10 minutes of your time. Before filling it in, ideally you'll have played the game through a few times to thoroughly stress test it. Play with different numbers of players, try and cheat the system, add in your own rules - do whatever you like to help us make it better for everyone.

### Will I be paid?

Mainly with our gratitude, but you'll also get:

  * the prototype for free (which you can keep)
  * a copy of the final game once it has been polished and put into production
  * a shout out as one of our official games testers on the game page
  * a discount code to spend on one of our other games
