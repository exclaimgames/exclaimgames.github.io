## FAQ

### How 'finished' will the games I get be?

They'll be fully functional games with a few elements still in draft. The artwork, packaging and instructions may be a little raw, but the way you play will be close to completion. That's not to say they won't evolve later on - your views on our prototypes will influence what happens next.

### How much feedback will you need on a prototype?

We'll email you a short form to complete. Before submitting it, ideally you'll have played the game a few times to thoroughly stress test it. Experiment with different numbers of players, try and cheat the system, or add in your own rules. Do whatever you like to help us make it better for everyone.

### Will I be paid?

Mainly with our gratitude, but you'll also get:

  * the prototype for free (which you can keep)
  * a copy of the final game once it has been polished and put into production
  * a shout out as one of our official games testers on the game page
  * a discount code to spend on our other games
