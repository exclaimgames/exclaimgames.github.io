  Like many things, it all started during the pandemic.

2020 was a crazy time full of lockdowns, furloughs and home-schooling. It was also a time when we had a lot of time on our hands, and there's only so much Netflix you can take.

So we dusted off a neglected collection of card games and found a rekindled love for the hobby. Playing card games quickly turned into creating new card games, and some of them turned out to be pretty good. That spiralled into properly developing and publishing them.

Endless sketches and thousands of hours of playtesting later and here we are, with a [roster of unique games](/games/) that we think are great.

We're proud to be a part of the UK's blossoming indie games industry, and are also proud of [our eco credentials](/sustainable-games/).
