## Calling all content creators

We're on the hunt for collaborators who can give an audience to our games. That could be a golf YouTube channel, a science podcast or a van life Instagram feed - whatever you do and whoever you do it for, there's an opportunity for us to turn it into a card game.

Our stack of prototypes is sitting waiting for the final themes, mechanics and designs to be added. All that's needed is a bit of input from you and we'll turn them into beautifully crafted branded games ready for your merch store.

### Interested?

Email [creator@exclaimgames.com](mailto:creator@exclaimgames.com) with links to your channel or social profiles and we'll arrange a call.
