  What's better than playing games? Playing games with the knowledge that they're having a positive impact on the planet.
  
---

Take a look through your games collection. There's rather a large amount of plastic, right? All those tiles, chips and playing pieces in shrink-wrapped boxes that have been shipped halfway around the world leave a huge footprint. Even your decks of playing cards are likely to be plastic-coated. 

We think enough's enough, and aim to be a positive force for change in the games industry.

## Putting the planet over profits

At Exclaim Games we promise to:

   * use sustainable materials for game production
   * use 100% plastic-free packaging
   * use local manufacturers and distributors
   * donate a percentage of every game sold to climate-positive projects

## Making Exclaim Games a B-Corp
 
It's easy to say these things, but much harder to do them. We want to be held accountable for our actions, so have applied for B-Corporation status. This is the globally recognised kitemark for companies doing their best to minimise and reverse the environmental impact of their operation.
